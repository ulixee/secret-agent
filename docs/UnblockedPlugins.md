# Unblocked Plugins

Agents support the [Unblocked Plugin][spec] specification, which ensures a Plugin can "hook" into the underlying Agent at the appropriate moments in the initialization of a [Browser](./Browser.md), [BrowserContext](./BrowserContext.md), [Page](./Page.md), [Worker](./Worker.md) or Network request.

Hooks can be used to emulate a Browser Engine or a Human user.
