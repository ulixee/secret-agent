# Remote

Hero operates out of the box over WebSockets. You'll eventually want to launch Core on a server where clients can remotely access it.

You'll need a simple script to start the server on the machine where the `ulixee` npm package is installed. Make sure to open the port you allocate on any firewall that a client might have to pass through:

## Setting Up a Server Process

Below is code you can use to start Core in your own server process. NOTE: you can also simply run the 'start.js' script that is packaged with `@ulixee/hero-core` at `@ulixee/hero-core/start`;

```javascript
// SERVER ip is 122.22.232.1
const Core = require('@ulixee/hero-core');

(async () => {
  Core.onShutdown = () => {
    log.info('Exiting Core Process');
    process.exit();
  };
  await Core.start({ coreServerPort: 7007 });
})();
```

## Setting Up the Client

Your [Hero](/docs/basic-interfaces/hero) or [Handler](/docs/basic-interfaces/handler) must be configured to point at this Remote Core (and any others you've set up).

NOTE: you can use the `@ulixee/hero-client` npm package if you don't want to install a full browser engine on the machine coordinating all your scrapes. That example is shown below.

```javascript
const Hero = require('@ulixee/hero-client');

(async () => {
  const hero = new Hero();
  await hero.configure({
    connectionToCore: {
      host: 'localhost:7007',
    },
  });

  await hero.goto('https://ulixee.org');
})().catch(console.log);
```
