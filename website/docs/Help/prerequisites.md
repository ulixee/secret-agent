# Prerequisites

To get started with Hero, you’ll need to have the following software tools installed:

### Node.js

Visit the [Node.js site](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the instructions to download and install the recommended version for your operating system. Once you have followed the installation steps, make sure everything was installed properly:

Open up your terminal.
- Run `node --version`. (If you’re new to the command-line, “run command” means “type node --version in the command prompt, and hit the Enter key”. From here on, this is what we mean by “run command”).
- Run `npm --version`.
- **The output of each of those commands should be a version number**. If entering those commands doesn’t show you a version number, go back and make sure you have installed **Node.js**.


### Yarn (Optional)
Yarn is a fast alternative to Npm. It's optional to install, but recommended since we use it in many code examples.
**Follow instruction here to install**: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
